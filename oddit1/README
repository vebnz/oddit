ODDIT (Odd IT jobs)

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/LPqr8.png

Started this about 3 years ago. We worked on it for a while but then we got caught up with life.

Eventually we made some more changes to it, were about to release it... and life consumed us again.

Now, 2015 life isn't quite so consuming so we're out to actually release it this time.

To use this source, you'll need to know Django, and have some stuff like django-registrations installed.
Packages required (install using pip):
- MySQLdb
- anyjson
- openid.association
- oauth2

There's not really much to making this work, it's all very simple-like. If you do end up fiddling with this code
remember parts of it were created 3 to 4 years ago, so that was most likely Django 1.2 (and Django 2.0 is nearly out).

You've been warned.
